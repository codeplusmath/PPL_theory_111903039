1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
    the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

    Basic blocks   3 and 4 correspond to the  while-loop.
    <bb7> corresponds to inner body of the loop.
    <bb4> corresponds to the conditional goto statement.
    A while loop is  nothing but  a  set  of basic  blocks  with conditional  control
    transfer, the only  notable difference between while loop and if-else statement is 
    being a jump to  a block that has been previously executed (i.e. a backward branch).


2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
    able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
    loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
    special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

    Basic blocks 6, 7 and 8 correspond to the nested for loop.(<bb6>, <bb7>, <bb8>).
    <bb6> corresponds to initialization. <bb7> corresponds to inner body and increments the loop.
    <bb8> corresponds to the conditional goto statement.
    When we compare "for" loop with "while" loop we find that for loop takes an extra basic block
    for initialization of looping variable, and has increment statement at the end of inner body
    loop.
