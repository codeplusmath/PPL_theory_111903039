1   In the file B-3.c, what values  can variable `a' take? Will the `if'
    condition [a  < 4] ever  be true?  Inspect the file  B-3.c.*.vrp1 to
    analyze the dump.

    The variable a can take values from 4 to 100, as it is initially initialized to 4
    and then it is incremented in for loop upto 100.
    The If condition [a  < 4] will never  be true, since it is initialized to 4,
    Hence [b = b +  2] is never executed.
