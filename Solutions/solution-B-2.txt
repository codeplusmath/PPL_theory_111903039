1   What will happen if "a = a + N" is replaced by "a = a + 1"?

     The loop will be unrolled and constant propogation will allow GCC to
    compute  the final  value of  `a'. Hence  the loop  will be  removed
    entirely.
    I tried it out and this is the .cunroll file:

;; Function main (main, funcdef_no=0, decl_uid=1908, cgraph_uid=1, symbol_order=1) (executed once)

main ()
{
  int a;
  int i;
  
  <bb 2> [local count: 214748368]:
  return 14;
  
} 
  
14 is returned because a=10+1+1+1+1 =>a=14
