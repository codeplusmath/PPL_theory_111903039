1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
    rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
    is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
    pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?

    The function body exists because it may be called from another file.
    The compiler cannot know about this before link time.


2   Is there any way to get rid of it?

    If the function was declared with the "static" keyword (which, in C,
    is something  like "private  to this file  only") then  the function
    body will disappear if there is no caller within the file.
